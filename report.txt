The inherited tree structure helps us to create Nodes with good structure. Using factor method allows me to create objects in a separate operation. It uses a interface for creating an object and provides more flexibility on creating Nodes. It also reduces some of the hard code, duplicate code in creating multiple objects. Using Singleton allows we only create at most one object of each class. But this is not good for subclasses.
